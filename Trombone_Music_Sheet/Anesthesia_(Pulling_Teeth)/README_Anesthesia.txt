"Anesthesia (Pulling Teeth)" is a song by Metallica from their debut album "Kill 'Em All," released in 1983. The song is a bass solo by Metallica's bassist at the time, Cliff Burton.

The song begins with a slow, melodic bass line, but quickly transitions into a frenetic, heavily distorted riff that showcases Burton's speed and technical proficiency.

Burton's use of distortion, wah-wah pedals, and other effects on his bass guitar in "Anesthesia (Pulling Teeth)" was groundbreaking at the time, and helped to establish him as one of the most innovative and influential bassists in heavy metal music.
